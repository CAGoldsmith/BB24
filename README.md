Scripts to generate the figures for: C. Goldsmith, M. Haustein, A. Büschges, and N. S. Szczecinski, “A biomimetic fruit fly robot for studying the neuromechanics of legged locomotion,” Bioinspir. Biomim., Sep. 2024, doi: 10.1088/1748-3190/ad80ec.

Scripts use the solver data from the BRDF-Solver repository and walking trial data from Run-Drosophibot-II and will not work correctly without them. Appropriate lines at the top of each script will also need to be changed to point to the correct file locations.

Scripts correspond to figure numbers as follows:

**Figure 3, Figure S6** - plotAnimalRobotSimCompKinematics.m

**Figure 4, Figure S7** - plotAnimalRobotSimCompDynamicsStiffness.m

**Figure 5** - quasiStaticFigurev2.m

**Figure 6** - plotWalkingDirectionComparison.m

**Figure 7** - plotRampTorques.m

**Figure S8** - plotDrosoTerrainComparison.m

**Figure S9** - plotDrosoTerrainCompGRF.m

Other scripts are considered obsolete and will likely not work.
