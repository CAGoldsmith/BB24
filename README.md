Scripts to generate the figures for: C. Goldsmith, M. Haustein, A. Büschges, and N. S. Szczecinski, “A biomimetic fruit fly robot for studying the neuromechanics of legged locomotion,” Bioinspir. Biomim., Sep. 2024, doi: 10.1088/1748-3190/ad80ec.

Scripts use the solver data from the BRDF-Solver repository and walking trial data from Run-Drosophibot-II and will not work correctly without them. Appropriate lines at the top of each script will also need to be changed to point to the correct file locations.
